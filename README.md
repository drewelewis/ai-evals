# Azure AI Foundry - Agent Evaluation Pipeline

🚀 **A comprehensive evaluation framework for Azure AI agents using multiple evaluation categories.**

This repository provides a complete evaluation pipeline with **10 specialized evaluators** across 4 categories, designed for thorough assessment of AI agent quality, safety, and performance.

## 📋 Overview

Our evaluation framework covers four main categories with **10 total evaluators**:
- **RAG & Retrieval** (3 evaluators) - For information retrieval accuracy
- **Agents** (2 evaluators) - For agent-specific behaviors  
- **General Purpose** (3 evaluators) - For overall response quality
- **Safety & Security** (2 evaluators) - For content safety and security

## 🚀 Main Evaluation Script: `foundry_evaluation.py` (Runs locally and generates outputs locally)

The **Foundry Evaluation Script** is our primary comprehensive evaluation tool that:
- ✅ **Runs all 10 evaluators locally** across 4 categories
- ✅ **Reads from `data/sample_data.jsonl`** automatically
- ✅ **Generates 4 separate JSONL files** for each category
- ✅ **Provides detailed console output** with scores and results
- ✅ **Handles errors gracefully** with proper exception handling

### Usage
```bash
python foundry_evaluation.py
```

### Output Files
Results are saved to `evaluation_results/` with timestamp:
- `foundry_rag_retrieval_results_[timestamp].jsonl`
- `foundry_agents_results_[timestamp].jsonl`
- `foundry_general_purpose_results_[timestamp].jsonl`
- `foundry_safety_security_results_[timestamp].jsonl`

## ☁️ Enhanced Cloud Deployment: `deploy_to_cloud2.py` (Runs locally and pushes the results to AI Foundry)

- **Implementation**: `CoherenceEvaluator` in `foundry_evaluation.py`
- **Scoring**: 1-5 scale (higher = more coherent)
- **Example**: Ensures architecture recommendations follow logical reasoning

### Fluency ✅
- **Purpose**: Measures natural language quality and readability
- **Implementation**: `FluencyEvaluator` in `foundry_evaluation.py`
- **Scoring**: 1-5 scale (higher = more fluent)
- **Example**: Ensures architecture advice is clearly written and grammatically correct

### Friendliness ✅ (Customer Evaluators)
- **Purpose**: Measures conversational tone and helpfulness
- **Implementation**: `FriendlinessEvaluator` (custom evaluator) in `foundry_evaluation.py`
